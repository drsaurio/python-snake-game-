# python-snake-game
This is just an update of the clasic "snake game" on python. This game runs in python 3.5.2 and it was for a class project 
at the school. I put some music and pictures for intro, some lines has been changed, but the structure is the same you will fine on the web.
Thanks and enjoy the game.
